 CB39:Food Waste Reduction Solution
 Develop a technology-driven solution to tackle food waste at various stages of the supply chain, from production to consumption, through innovative tracking, redistribution, and waste prevention strategies.					Lets look at the various ways of preventing the food waste because totally eliminating it is not factually possible:-
So starting :



1)Right from the production part as some of us already know the constant protest going on by farmers in our country because they want the MSP to be LEGALISED and thats where the exact main problem lies.
Becoz in our country we are producing a big surplus amount of grains which our govt need to buy from farmers and it is kept to be rotten out for years and millions of tons are still getting wasted in any of the several thousand food storage facility.
The surplus amount not only get wasted but it also give us a bad habit where we take our food and grains for granted.
If we take example of an food deficit continent like africa the food is much more valued by the public.

If we wanna reduce the food waste we need a proper calculation where the required and total food amount produced should go hand in hand:

2)The second way can be spreading awarness by showing the proper importance of food and its criticality if its not available, by this we can aware the youth of what is the importnace of even a sole piece of grain.We can do awarness camps and with the help of social media it can be circuilated everywhere.

The third and final point is the solution that if the food is already wasted it could atleast by of some use to us directly or indirectly:

3)We would have to make a proper waste disposal system where people can undersand the concept and grasp it quickly by which they would be properly able to help in this good act and gain the benifit from it too.The food waste cannot be eliminated but can be turn into something hugely benificial.And thats where our main concept of website is devloped upon:
"TURNING GARBAGE TO GOLD"
