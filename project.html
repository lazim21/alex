            <p>Right from the production part as some of us already know the constant protest going on by farmers in our country because they want the MSP to be LEGALISED and thats where the exact main problem lies.
                Becoz in our country we are producing a big surplus amount of grains which our govt need to buy from farmers and it is kept to be rotten out for years and millions of tons are still getting wasted in any of the several thousand food storage facility.
                The surplus amount not only get wasted but it also give us a bad habit where we take our food and grains for granted.
                If we take example of an food deficit continent like africa the food is much more valued by the public.</p>

            <h2>What is food-waste?</h2>
            <p>
                Food waste is any type of food that is discarded or not eaten. It can include uneaten food from meals, spoiled food, trimmings from food preparation, and food products that have been damaged and deemed unfit for human consumption.<br>
            </p>
            <p>The problem of food waste is one of the key unresolved issues of the modern world. While people living in some parts of the world throw away the products which they no longer want or which they bought thoughtlessly, others suffer from hunger and are not able to buy any food. However, it is not only the question of inequality that strikes society. Apart from economic complications, food waste generates many problems of social and environmental nature.</p><br>
            <p>Spoiled products can be harmful to people’s or animals’ health. The recycling process for such food is costly and energy-consuming. The foodservice industry is the most dangerous in this respect since it produces large amounts of food, a great part of which remains unwanted and becomes wasted. The present paper offers an overview of the main causes and outcomes of food waste. Solutions for management and prevention of the problem are offered, along with the discussion of barriers to their implementation. The problem of food waste is too serious to be overlooked, and everyone is responsible for making it subside.</p>
